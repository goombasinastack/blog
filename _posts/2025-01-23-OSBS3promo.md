## What? Who?? When??? Where???? Why?????

Woah, woah, slow down, buckaroo!!!

One Shared Braincell, or OSB, is a radio show me and some friends started in Spring 2024 because it's fun. It broadcasts on KMNR 89.7 FM in Rolla, Missouri. We've done two semesters of shows so far, but only now do I have a blog to shamelessly self-promote on!

This semester, Spring 2025, we'll be doing weekly shows on Thursdays, starting at 8 PM and ending at 9 PM CST. 

You can listen live online [here](https://www.kmnr.org/), or alternatively, I post our show recordings up on Spotify semi-regularly. You can listen to those [here](https://open.spotify.com/show/6LJ0uw1NqlgWd0zcOhMUDS?si=10337a14e9f04ee1)!

As this post goes live on January 23rd, we should have just posted the first episode of the new season to Spotify.


## That's all neat, but what's the show about?

Well, it's fairly simple: we've ripped off [Tom Scott's Technical Difficulties](https://www.techdif.co.uk/) game Two Of These People Are Lying. It's a fairly simple game: three people each pick out a Wikipedia article and put it in an envelope. The host, a fourth person, then picks one of the articles and reads it aloud. 

One of the players will know what that article is; two will not. All players must try to convince the host--usually me, DJ Kittycat--that whatever they say the article is about is true. (Two players lie, hence the name).

Points are given to the player deemed the most believable--and if that player is indeed telling the truth, the host gets a point as well. Bababooey!

If that explanation confused you, [:here's the original British folks explaining it](https://youtu.be/phL7P6gtZRM?si=IK4560tU2U8M1siv).

## But anyways, yeah!
Remember, live Thursdays 8PM CST on [KMNR 89.7 FM](https://www.kmnr.org/), or listen to old shows on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/6LJ0uw1NqlgWd0zcOhMUDS?si=10337a14e9f04ee1). I'm aiming to record most shows to post this semester (unlike the last two seasons) so the page should populate rather nicely.

(This embed should show the latest episode available on Spotify.)

## Nutshells
[:What's a nutshell?](#-nutshell-guide)

### :x Nutshell guide
  Nutshells are snapshots of sections from other pages, or other parts of the same page. You can use them in your own sites: visit [here](https://ncase.me/nutshell/)!

  Self-referential nutshells congregate at the bottom of the page, much like footnotes--except you don't need to scroll all the way back up, since they're embedded in the text. Score!

  (The table of contents preview breaks a bit, though.)
