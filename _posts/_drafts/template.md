### :x Nutshell guide
  Nutshells are snapshots of sections from other pages, or other parts of the same page. You can use them in your own sites: visit [here](https://ncase.me/nutshell/)!

  Self-referential nutshells congregate at the bottom of the page, much like footnotes--except you don't need to scroll all the way back up, since they're embedded in the text. Score!

  (The table of contents preview breaks a bit, though.)
