Once upon a summer day, a young boy was allowed to play his sister's boyfriend's Gamecube. What did that boy do? Open City Escape, run terrified from a truck, and bumble to the exit. 

And then select Aquatic Mine, ruining any further interest he had in the game.



Well, not really. He went to the Chao Garden, messed about, and got in trouble for "ruining" a save file. He was forevermore condemned to only play the racing minigame (which he hardly played, since Mario Kart DS was a more appealing option).

As expected, he quickly lost interest.

But now, I'm at least twice as old and twice as transgender! What could go wrong, for my first Sonic game?

## Version Notes

I played the Steam release of Sonic Adventure 2: Battle, with a few mods. I hadn't touched the game in many, many years--so that may sound sacreligious to play for the "first" time with mods installed! But I like to play the best version of a game so that I can enjoy it the most that I possibly can. Here's a list:

| Mod name                   | Author                 |                           Notes |
| :------------------------- | :--------------------- | ------------------------------: |
| Sonic Adventure 2 Animated | Totally Not A Skeleton |                Animation tweaks |
| Sonic New Tricks           | Sora                   | Faster spindash, control remaps |
| Mania Drop Dash            | Henrykado              |          Adds Mania's drop dash |
| SA2 Input Controls         | Shaddatic              |                Analog stick fix |

The only major gameplay changes were the faster spindash and the drop dash, which felt seamless in their implementation. I had drop dash mapped to a hold input on the Bounce Bracelet button (X, on a Nintendo Pro controller), spindash and somersault on Y, and A for jump/homing attack. But let's get on with it:

## Booting Up

Once you boot into SA2, get past the opening movie, you're dumped into what's arguably the sickest, most rad title screen ever. It screeams 2001! You hear a sick guitar rendition of the game's theme as you watch art of the game's characters slowly fall down. It's the mark of a game that's so earnest, you can't help but smile.

After the arcade-racer-esque voice asks you select a file, you're dropped into the main menu, which features a [:different version](#booting-up) of Live and Learn.
