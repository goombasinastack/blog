## the best introduction to a blogpost ever

i really like spaghetti. it's one of my comfort foods; over winter break i've just been making it over and over because 1) it's easy and 2) autism.......

but during thanksgiving break i got the miraculous idea to film myself making spaghetti, like the gay fag that i am, lmao. 

so


## Damn, So You Actually Did That Huh

{% include embed/youtube.html id='zTuJln_bg4k' %}

yeap. that's right. a Whole Fifty Minute Video Detailing My Specifically Streamlined Spaghetti-Making Process. it's one take, just as i intended.

i filmed it on my phone (iphone 15 on final cut camera if you must know) using a little shitty k'nex stand i threw together in twenty minutes, and honestly, i couldn't be happier. i think the color grading on it is Stellar for what it is--i love how the cool light from the window interacts with the warm light from the microwave oven.

but i've made this recipe 20 more times since then, at least. and i found an advancement in pasta techniques...


## the holy grail of pasta. the pastagrail. Yeahg

okay so lemme just boil up some water to show y'all wh-- IT EXPLODED FUCK

it's pretty simple! so what happened is i ran out of tomato paste. but i had plenty of sauce. so i broke (sorry) the noodles in half (actually i'm not sorry. L) so they could fit in the saucepan and just. Cooked Them In The Sauce (i now use 2 standard size cans or about 30 oz of sauce, plus about half a can of water that boils off in cooking.)

and guess what???? it Worked!!! it Worked!!! and it was beautiful. Jesus Wept.

you get all the nice starchiness in the sauce that would originally be lost in the pasta water, and it makes it Better.

also, i learned that Salt Makes It Even Better. like yes, i know i touched on it in the video--but i was not Using Enough Salt. i took advice from some cooking video on youtube i forget: salt will Keep Making It Taste Better until it Doesn't. and your goal is to be Right On That Edge.

i think that's all i have to say about spaghetti [:right now](#spaghetti-from-the-past).


## blog updates

i've been doing some work on the site today! i wrote up an article that'll post next week, wrote This article, and finally implemented comments into the site (after eleven attempts, i realised i simply mispelled my username. RIP)! i'm using giscus, a free open-source engine that turns github's native Discussions feature into a blogpost-style commenting embed. so if you scroll downwards, you can now send your thoughts! directly into my email inbox! 

Yay!

i'll probably tackle updating the [:favicon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favicon) next.


in other, more categorical news, i think low-effort posts like these--where i forego capitalisation for stylistic purposes--will go under the 'kylieposting' tag. 


i think that's about it for now. see y'all soon!

## Nutshells
[:What's a nutshell?](#-nutshell-guide)

### :x Nutshell guide
  Nutshells are snapshots of sections from other pages, or other parts of the same page. You can use them in your own sites: visit [here](https://ncase.me/nutshell/)!

  Self-referential nutshells congregate at the bottom of the page, much like footnotes--except you don't need to scroll all the way back up, since they're embedded in the text. Score!

  (The table of contents preview breaks a bit, though.)

### :spaghetti from the past
  i was originally gonna put an old discord text here where i detailed how to make "kyliecat's clinically insane spaghetti" but i can't find it right now, and it's almost bedtime for me, and i'm eepy, and maybe i'll do it later. if you really really want it get in the comments
